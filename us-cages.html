	<p>Rat cages are incredibly important for a rat's wellbeing. A rat cage should meet all their needs and keep them safe and contained at the same time. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find a good cage for a variety of reasons; price can be a barrier to many and rampant misinformation online can mislead us into buying poor cages. Pet stores push small and inappropriate cages and certain rat communities may shame us for not buying cages that meet extravagant minimums (or even push the same myths that pet stores do!).</p>
	<p>One big myth about caging you'll hear is the importance of height over floor space. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12id5oRMujqTKEwkDSRwpvGi5oUgXbSSz/view">This isn't true</a>! Rats are fossorial animals and prefer floor space over height. An abundance of height can actually be really dangerous; rats aren't great climbers and can be seriously or fatally injured by falls. A cage should have enough floor space for the amount of rats you want and enough cage clutter to keep them both enriched and safe. There should be no gaps large enough to leave your rats susceptible to fall damage.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, some cages aren't suitable out of the box. This is mainly due to two reasons: inappropriate bar spacing or wire flooring. Exposed wire flooring is bad for their feet and can cause bumblefoot. Thankfully, many cages come with wire floors that slide out or come with trays that can sit on top of the bars. If your cage has neither, you can do a bit of DIY and buy or make a hard covering. Wide bar spacing can lead to escapees. Ideal wire spacing is 1/2 inches. 3/8 inch bar spacing is amazing as well. Bar spacing wider than half an inch but smaller than 1 can be suitable for adult males but not females or young rats. Wide bar spacing can be fixed by wrapping the cage in hardware cloth. Hardware cloth is stronger than chicken wire and can't be chewed through. <a href="https://www.silversrattery.co.uk/husbandry">Silver's Rattery</a> has some instructions (and a lot of other good care info!) on rat-proofing cages with big bar spacing.</p>
	<p>This list will not include wooden cages or tanks/tank toppers. Rats need secure cages that cannot be chewed out of. For this reason, wooden cages aren't suitable. Tanks aren't suitable because they lack ventilation, even with tank toppers. Because rats have incredibly sensitive respiratory systems, they require cages with good ventilation and a suitable bedding to absorb ammonia.</p>

	<p>Ferplast cages can be amazing and are technically available in the US but are a lot more expensive because they're imported. If you already have one or can get it for cheap, they're great options, but not worth spending extra on.</p>

	<p>The cages listed below need alterations in order to be safe. You can find tons of rabbit or guniea pig cages with nice floor space but unsafe bar spacing; ideally you'd buy a cage that's safe and needs little modification from the get-go. These cages are listed here in case you already have these OR you're willing to put the work in and have little other options.</p>
